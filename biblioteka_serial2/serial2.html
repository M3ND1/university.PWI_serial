<H3>Foreword</h3>
<div class="description">
<b>If you experience any problem using this software, please be
sure that you have the latest version. Check our web site <a href="http://www.tetraedre.com">www.tetraedre.com
</a> for an updated version of the software.&nbsp;<br>
Otherwise report any bug to the address above or check the FAQ</b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Here it is. Finally, I think I've reached the final step in serial communication
programmation on Win32. This new version (V2.1) is much more structured
when the previous one. I can handle either 1-byte exchange (like a UART)
or arrays of byte. The application is 100% event-driven on the user side
(the object itself is using one thread). And more important of all, this
new version handles also modem specific signals like CD and RI. CD allows
you to know if the modem is connected (to the other modem) or if you are
in command mode. And RI is the RING indicator.
<br>With this version, you can make whatever you like (like for example
implementing PPP or simulating a microcontroller's UART)
<br>

<h3>Download</h3>
<div class="description">
I've removed the "non event-driven" version since I believe it is not so
usefull. Anyway, you can still download the V1.x package here 
(<a href="serial.zip">serial.zip</a>) or read its documentation 
<a href="serial1.php3">here</a><BR>.
The version 2 can be downloaded here (<a href="serial2.zip">serial2.zip</a>).
<br>
</div>

<h3>Feedback</h3>
<div class="description">
I hope that this version will be the ultimate library for the serial port.
I hope to receive your comments about it. Since the version 1.x was downloaded
more than 4'000 times in 8 months, I hope this one will be even better.
If you like this software, please let me know, 'cause I like to know what
people think of my work.<br>
<br>
Please find hereafter the updated version of the documentation.

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<div class="description">Each programmer knows that accessing the hardware ports of
a computer is getting more and more complicated. The software presented
here intends to ease the development of applications using the serial port
(COM) on computer running Windows 32-bits operating systems.<BR>
<BR>
Allen Denver, from the Microsoft Windows Developer Support wrote one
of the only technical article describing in details how to use the serial
port under Win32. This article can be downloaded on Microsoft's web site.
A copy of this article can also be found <a href="msdn_serial.htm">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
From that article, I've written two different software packages. You
are currently reading the documentation of version 2.x which is an "event-driven"
communication component. I define it event-driven since there is no busy
loop, no blocking waiting inside the whole software. Everything is done
on events, and can thus be very easily integrated inside a Windows application
(with user interface).<BR>
<BR>
All software and documentation described here can be downloaded directly
here : <a href="serial2.zip">serial2.zip</a><BR>
<BR>
This software was developed with C++ Borland Builder 5 and tested also
with Visual C++ 6.<BR>

<h3>Compilation with Borland C++ Builder</h3>
<div class="description">
The ZIP file contains two Borland C++ project files (serialtest.bpr). Simply
open them, compile, run and enjoy !<BR>
<BR>
</div>



<h3>Compilation with Microsoft Visual C++</h3>
<div class="description">
The project was originally created to be compiled with the Borland C++
Builder development environment. In order to permit compilation&nbsp; with
Microsoft's Visual C++, I've modified a little the source code. A "#ifdef
__BORLANDC__" has been inserted in the header part of the <i>serialtest.cpp</i>
file in order to skip some Borland's specific pre-compiler commands.<br>
<br>
<b>IMPORTANT</b>
<br>But more important. The event-driven application uses multithreading
in order to generate the events. So Visual C++ projects that use multithreading
must be compiled with the appropriate setting. In your project settings,
you MUST choose the multithreaded run-time library, otherwise the programme
will not compile

<h3>Events description</h3>
<div class="description">
Before going into details, I would like to describe a little bit the concept
that I used here: In order to work with the serial port, you need to create
a Tserial_event object and configure it. In particular you must specify
a "manager". This is a callback function used by the serial object to notify
events. Seven kind of events can occur:
<ol>
    <li>SERIAL_CONNECTED</li>
    <li>SERIAL_DISCONNECTED</li>
    <li>SERIAL_DATA_SENT</li>
    <li>SERIAL_DATA_ARRIVAL</li>
    <li>SERIAL_RING</li>
    <li>SERIAL_CD_ON</li>
    <li>SERIAL_CD_OFF</li>
</ol>
These events will help managing the serial port (or the modem) successfully
and efficiently. They are also usefull to manipulate input and output message
buffers.

<table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=2>
<tr><th>Event</th><th>Description</th></tr>

<tr>
    <td>SERIAL_CONNECTED</td>
    <td>This event is generated when the serial port is opened and ready to
    work. If the port is not opened successfully, the <b>connect </b>returns
    directly with an error value</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>SERIAL_DISCONNECTED</td>
    <td>This event is generated when the serial communication is closed. This
    might occur either after you called <b>disconnect</b> or if an error occured</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>SERIAL_DATA_SENT</td>
    <td>This event is generated when the data you want to transmit have been
    passed to the device driver (this doesn't mean that they reached the other
    side of the serial cable). This event will allow you to send further outgoing
    message and thus avoiding output buffer overflow. If you send only one
    byte after the other, this event is similar to the UART's "TX EMPTY" IRQ.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>SERIAL_DATA_ARRIVAL</td>
    <td>This event is generated when data are received. You can specify how
    much data you would like to receive by calling <b>setRxSize</b>, but this
    doesn't mean that you will receive that number of data. Once again, if
    you specify an RxSize of 1, then the event is similar to the UART's "RX
    FULL" IRQ.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>SERIAL_RING</td>
    <td>This event is generated when a RING occurs on your telephone line (if
    you have a modem and if you specified to notify modem's events).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>SERIAL_CD_ON</td>
    <td>This event is generated when the modem is connected to the other modem
    (for example after an "ATDT" command). For example, if you want to implement
    PPP, this will tell you if you can send modem's command (ATZ,...) or if
    you can send PPP messages.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>SERIAL_CD_OFF</td>
    <td>This event is the opposite of CD_ON, it indicates when the communication
    with the other modem dropped.</td>

<h4>Events</h4>
<div class="description">
When an event occurs, the serial object call the callback function (if
not null). This function must have the following prototype:
<pre>void SerialEventManager(uint32 object, uint32 event)</pre>
where <i>uint32&nbsp;</i> is an unsigned long.<br>
<br>
The <b>object</b> field is the address of the serial communication object
that has called the callback function.
<br><b>event</b> is the event kind that occured. It can be any of the seven
values described above. For six of them, the event is notified with no
additionnal data. The SERIAL_DATA_ARRIVAL is associated with data. These
one can be retrieved by calling <b>getDataInSize</b> and <b>getDataInBuffer</b>,
like described hereafter.
<br>&nbsp;

<pre>
void SerialEventManager(uint32 object, uint32 event)
{
    char *buffer;
    int   size;
    Tserial_event *com;

    com = (Tserial_event *) object;
    if (com!=0)
    {
        switch(event)
        {
            case  SERIAL_CONNECTED  :
                                        printf("Connected ! \n");
                                        break;
            case  SERIAL_DISCONNECTED  :
                                        printf("Disonnected ! \n");
                                        break;
            case  SERIAL_DATA_SENT  :
                                        printf("Data sent ! \n");
                                        break;
            case  SERIAL_RING       :
                                        printf("DRING ! \n");
                                        break;
            case  SERIAL_CD_ON      :
                                        printf("Carrier Detected ! \n");
                                        break;
            case  SERIAL_CD_OFF     :
                                        printf("No more carrier ! \n");
                                        break;
            case  SERIAL_DATA_ARRIVAL  :
                                        size   = com->getDataInSize();
                                        buffer = com->getDataInBuffer();
                                        OnDataArrival(size, buffer);
                                        com->dataHasBeenRead();
                                        break;
        }
    }
}

</pre>
</div>



<H4>Interfacing with C++</H4>
<div class="description">
One of the major problem encoutered here is the fact that the SerialEventManager
functio is a C function and not the method of a C++ object. Using C++ callback
is not as easy as using C callback.<BR>
In order to solve partially this problem, use the owner field of the Tserial_event
class. You can give him the address of a C++ object to be called by the callback
function.<BR>

<pre>
    com->owner = (void *) object1;
</pre>
Where object1 is a pointer to a Tmyobject having a method named <BR>
<pre>SerialCallback(Tserial_event *com_source, uint32 event);</pre>
So in the callback function you can do the following stuff:

<pre>
void SerialEventManager(uint32 object, uint32 event)
{
    Tserial_event *com;
    Tmyobject *object;

    com = (Tserial_event *) object;
    if (com!=0)
    {
        object = (Tmyobject *) com->owner;
        if (object!=0)
            object->SerialCallback(com, event);
    }
}
</pre>
